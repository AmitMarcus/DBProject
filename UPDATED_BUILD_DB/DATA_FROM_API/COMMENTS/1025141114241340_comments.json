We try to fix something but you can\u2019t fix what you can\u2019t see. It\u2019s the soul that needs the surgery. It\u2019s time that we take a stand. How can you expect someone else to love you if you don\u2019t love yourself? You have to be happy with yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter what you look like on the outside, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Today, I want to put up a makeup-free photo. I know I have wrinkles on my skin but today I want you to see beyond that. I want to embrace the real me and I want you to embrace who you are, the way you are, and love yourself just the way you are.\u201d \u2013 \n\n- #JuliaRoberts\n\nWhat each one of us is looking for is true acknowledgement of Self and others.
