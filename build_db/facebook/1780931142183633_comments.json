The production employs all the techniques of Brecht in a South East Asian context. The play was originally written in English. It is performed in Chinese (with surtitles) in a Malay theatrical context. I had no trouble understanding it.\n\nThe staging is thrilling, The acting and movement are intensely physical -- and relate to Malay martial arts and dance -- as well as Indonesian Wayang, mask, and puppetry. Tuan Chye's script is full of reference to contemporary political issues and events in Singapore and Malaysia. Exactly what Brecht wanted to achieve in his writing.\n\nAbove all, the production is highly theatrical. It is long but holds the audience because of its inventiveness, energy, and verve. The stage is always alive and we are always engaged.\nOnly this weekend. Go see it.",
