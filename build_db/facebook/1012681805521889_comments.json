            "message": "\ud83c\udf1eA \"Super Collaboration\" may sound like some subatomic phenomenon, but in this case it is an event where I have the honour to perform with three of the finest musicians I have met in my 31 years in Japan. This concert is a tribute to the Kid Ailack Art Hall space which is due to close this Dec. 31 after inspiring its visitors for 52 years.\n\u2022 Sizzle Ohtaka has been described as having a \"rainbow voice\" of many colours, from ultra-pure Japanese folk through spicy ethnic variations to the wildest free improv.\n\u2022 Akikazu Nakamura is an acknowledged master of traditional shakuhachi, while also performing prog-rock and modern jazz.\n\u2022 Carl Stone weaves extraordinary organic tapestries of electronic sound from his customised laptop. \n\u2022 Yours truly (Morgan Fisher) blends vintage analogue keyboards with digital looping to create deep, layered soundscapes.\nA rare chance to hear the four of us improvising solo and in various combinations to create a rich, unpredictable cornucopia of living music!",
