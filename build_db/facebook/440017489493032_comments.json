A very important example of what I have been trying to show you in your petitioning and letter writing. This is a partial copy of a joint letter submitted by the BLM and USFS to the U.S. Attny General's office asking for law enforcement action to be taken regarding the terrorist thugs in Oregon. This post comes from a FB group involved in opposing wild horse slaughter in the USA. The poster had a .pdf file of the full letter but was unable to post it online. What follows is her post which whole-heartedly support and vouch for...\n... Anyway, it's dated 01/05/16 and here's the gist of it:\n \"For decades, the Bundy family has violated federal laws and flagrantly defied federal authorities that were enforcing the orders of the Federal Court and the law. These highly publicized actions included pointing powerful weapons at federal law enforcement officers and threatening to shoot. A recent article in the Oregonian quoted activist Ryan Payne as saying (referring to the Bundy standoff) \"We had counter-sniper positions on their sniper positions. We had at least one guy -sometimes two guys \u2014per BLM agent in there. If they made one wrong move, every single BLM agent in that camp would have died.\" \n\nThe threats to public land managers and federal law enforcement have continued, with no consequences. Since the Bundy issue was made prominent in 2014, there have been other confrontations in Nevada, Utah, and Oregon. The current issue in Oregon involves the armed occupation of a National Wildlife Refuge headquarters.\n\nAs you know, the F.B.I. defines \"domestic terrorism\" as actions which have three characteristics: (l) Involve acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law; (2) Appear intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (3) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. The Bundy actions have these three characteristics.\nTheodore Roosevelt, a champion of the public lands, said it best, \"In a moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing to do, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.\"\n\n In the current circumstances, doing nothing has allowed these domestic terrorists to act with impunity. It puts public land managers and Federal law enforcement officials at risk and has created an environment in which the American people are being cheated from the use and enjoyment of their public lands. The Rule of Law has been completely undermined by the lack of prosecution in these cases.\"",

            "message": "Lesson 5- More on writing letters: \n\nLetters are a very effective tool for reaching the public, your legislators, and companies. Here are instructions for three types of letters used in animal rights campaigns:\n\nLetters to the Editor\nLetters to the editors of your local newspapers are a great way to reach a large audience, many of whom probably never thought about animal issues before. Discuss only one issue per letter, and if applicable, tell the reader how to take action. If you are responding to an article that appeared in the newspaper, mention the article. Keep your letter short and to the point. Look at the letters published by your local newspaper for guidance on the length of your letter. If the issue deserves a longer discussion, look at the length of the Op-Ed pieces published by the newspaper and tailor your letter to be published as an Op-Ed. Make sure you provide your contact information so the editors can confirm that you are the author of the letter.\n\nLetters to Legislators\nLetters to legislators are important because they let the legislators know how their constituents feel about the issues. Remember to be polite, but be clear about your position. If you are writing about a particular piece of legislation, try to provide the bill number, because there are sometimes multiple bills pending on a single subject. End the letter by asking them where they stand on the issue, and be sure to provide your contact information so they can see that you are a constituent and can get back to you.\n\nLetters to Companies\nLetters to companies can be very effective because they are frequently part of a larger boycott campaign. If you are boycotting a company because they conduct animal testing, send them a letter so they know why they\u2019ve lost your business. As always, be clear but polite, and be sure to include your contact information so they can get back to you. Sometimes they will try to justify their actions, but every once in a while, a company will write to tell you that they are changing their practices!\n\nHow to Write Effective Letters to Congress\n\nKeep it Simple\n\nYour letter should address a single topic or issue. Typed, one-page letters are best. Many PACs \n(Political Action Committees) recommend a three-paragraph letter structured like this:\n\nSay why you are writing and who you are. List your \"credentials.\" (If you want a response, you must include your name and address, even when using email.)\nProvide more detail. Be factual not emotional. Provide specific rather than general information about how the topic affects you and others. If a certain bill is involved, cite the correct title or number whenever possible.\nClose by requesting the action you want taken: a vote for or against a bill, or change in general policy.\nThe best letters are courteous, to the point, and include specific supporting examples.\n\nAddressing Members of Congress\n\nTo Your Senator:\n\nThe Honorable (full name)\n(Room #) (Name) Senate Office Building\nUnited States Senate\nWashington, DC 20510\n\nDear Senator:\n\nTo Your Representative:\n\nThe Honorable (full name)\n(Room #) (Name) House Office Building\nUnited States House of Representatives\nWashington, DC 20515\n\nDear Representative:\nThe above addresses should be used in email messages, as well as those sent through the Postal Service.\n\nFinding Their Addresses\n\nSenate and House of Representatives\n\nU.S. Senators (web sites and mailing addresses)\nhttp://www.senate.gov/\n\nWrite Your U.S. Representative (A service of the House that will assist you by identifying your Congressperson in the U.S. House of Representatives and providing contact information.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court\n\nContact Information - US Supreme Court\nhttp://usgovinfo.about.com/blsupct.htm\n\nThe Justices do not have email addresses, but they do read letters from citizens.\n\nTo Conclude\n\nHere are some key things you should always and never do in writing to your elected representatives.\n\nBe courteous and respectful without \"gushing.\"\nClearly and simply state the purpose of your letter. If it's about a certain bill, identify it correctly. If you need help in finding the number of a bill, use the Thomas Legislative Information System.\nhttps://www.congress.gov/\n\nSay who you are. Anonymous letters go nowhere. Even in email, include your correct name, address, phone number and email address. If you don't include at least your name and address, you will not get a response.\nState any professional credentials or personal experience you may have, especially those pertaining to the subject of your letter.\nKeep your letter short -- one page is best.\nUse specific examples or evidence to support your position.\nState what it is you want done or recommend a course of action.\nThank the member for taking the time to read your letter.\n\nNever use vulgarity, profanity, or threats. The first two are just plain rude and the third one can get you a visit from the Secret Service. Simply stated, don't let your passion get in the way of making your point,\nDon't fail to include your name and address, even in email letters.\nRequest a response.\n\nIdentifying Legislation\n\nCite these legislation identifiers when writing to members of Congress:\n\nHouse Bills: \"H.R._____\"\nHouse Resolutions: \"H.RES._____\"\nHouse Joint Resolutions: \"H.J.RES._____\"\nSenate Bills: \"S._____\"\nSenate Resolutions: \"S.RES._____\"\nSenate Joint Resolutions: \"S.J.RES._____\"\nhttp://www.house.gov/representatives/\n\nIf you get an impressive number of signatures on a petition, or if the petition concerns a hot issue in the news, you may be able to interest the media. Send out a press release announcing a date, time and place where the petitions will be delivered to the legislator. If you get media coverage, this will help spread your message and may inspire more people to contact their legislators.",
