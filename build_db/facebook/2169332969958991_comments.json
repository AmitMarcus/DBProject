I'm a little concerned because it's considerably farther from the new starting point than Union Station, the original drop off point. I'm 67 yrs old with knees that hurt in cold weather and the March will be quite challenging for me. It's another mile and a quarter walk from the new location to the March. Here's a map. There's public transportation but if you look at that option it looks like there's walking involved there also and will it handle the numbers of the disembarked?  Any insight or solutions for the physically challenged from the organizers? Thanks.",
